Automatically upload media to Amazon S3 and integrate with Imgix, a real-time image processing CDN.  Boosts site performance and simplifies workflows.

== Description ==

Media Cloud by ILAB is a suite of tools designed to enhance media handling in WordPress in a number of ways.

**NOTE**: This plugin requires PHP 5.6x or higher (PHP 7.x preferred)

= Upload to S3, Minio, Google Cloud Storage, Wasabi and Digital Ocean Spaces =
Automatically copy media uploads to the cloud and serve them directly from your cloud storage provider, CloudFront or any other CDN.  Additionally, easily import your existing media library with the push of a button.

= Integrate with Imgix =
[Imgix](https://imgix.com) will radically change the way that you build your WordPress sites and themes.  This plugin is the best integration available for WordPress.  Upload your images to S3 with our S3 tool and then host the media with Imgix, providing you with real-time image processing and automatic format delivery.  Forget ImageMagick, Imgix is light years ahead in quality and speed.

= Native support for Google Cloud Storage =
Now supports using Google Cloud Storage for uploads without having to use Google's S3 compatible interop mode.  Supports direct uploads too.

= Native Support For Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage =
Now supports using Backblaze's new B2 Cloud Storage for uploads.

= Upload Directly To S3, Minio, Wasabi and Google Cloud Storage =
Directly upload your media and documents to the cloud, bypassing your WordPress server completely.  This feature requires Imgix.

= Automatically Tag and Categorize with Amazon Rekognition =
Use Amazon's latest AI tools to tag and categorize your images when uploading to Amazon S3.  With Rekognition, you can automatically detect objects, scenes, and faces in images.

= Advanced Image Editing =
When integrating with [Imgix](https://imgix.com), Media Cloud by ILAB provides the most advanced WordPress image editor.  Alter contrast, saturation, vibrancy and over 30 other image editing operations - in real time right inside the WordPress admin interface!  Completely non-destructive!

= Image Cropping =
Media Cloud by ILAB ships with the most advanced image cropping tool available for WordPress, based on Chen Fengyuan's amazing Cropper plugin for jQuery.

= WP-CLI Support =
Import your media library to the cloud, regenerate thumbnails and process your library with Amazon Rekognition using WP-CLI commands.

**Best of all you get this functionality for free.**

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/ilab-media-tools` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. For Cloud Storage, enter your credentials in the *Media Cloud -> Storage Settings* page.
4. For Imgix, enter your Imgix settings in the *Media Cloud -> Imgix Settings* page.
5. Enable the tools you want through the *Media Cloud -> Tools* settings page.
6. Once your settings are complete, use the *Media Cloud -> Storage Importer* to import your current media library to
   Amazon S3 or whatever storage service you are using.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this compare to WP Offload S3? =

This essentially does everything that WP Offload S3 does but is free.  It includes an import function for importing your current library to S3 that only the pro version of WP Offload S3 has.  Otherwise, they work almost exactly the same.

= Why should I use Imgix? =

One of the headaches of managing a WordPress site is dealing with server disk space.  If you just use the S3 functionality of this plugin, you are already one step ahead.  Using S3, all of your media is centrally located in one place that you can then distribute through a high performing content delivery network to improve page load speeds for your site.  You also don't have to worry about disk space on your servers anymore.

Imgix is a content delivery network with a twist.  In addition to distributing your media, it also allows you to edit them, in real-time. and deliver the edited version through their CDN without altering the original.  Want to add a new image size to your theme?  You can do this with Imgix without having to use a plugin to recut all of your existing media to this new size.  Imgix optimizes format delivery and a bunch of other things.  It's seriously the greatest thing to happen to WordPress and web development in the history of ever.

= Are you a paid shill for Imgix? =

No, I'm just one very enthusiastic customer.

== Screenshots ==

1. Easy image cropping for all croppable image sizes defined in your theme.
2. Make adjustments to your images like saturation, vibrancy, contrast when using Imgix.
3. Stylize your images easily when using Imgix.
3. Watermarking is easy and non-destructive, change the watermark at any time and all watermarked images will automatically update.
4. Amazon S3 settings.
6. Imgix settings.

== Changelog ==

= 2.1.0 =
* Added support for Wasabi (https://wasabi.com) storage service
* Direct uploads via Wasabi (requires Imgix)
* Fix for direct uploads failing
* Fix for CSS issues on settings pages

= 2.0.9 =
* Added support for detecting faces using Imgix's API.  You can enable this setting in the Imgix settings.  With the detected faces, you can use those in the `Focus Crop` settings of the image editor.  **Note** that Rekognition does a vastly superior job in detecting faces (sorry Imgix) and I would urge you to use that instead.  But if you aren't using Amazon S3 for storage, you'll have to use the Imgix face detection if you want to use the Focus Crop feature.
* Added support for Imgix's Entropy and Edges cropping modes (https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url/size/crop).  You can access these in the image editor.

= 2.0.8 =
* Added support for Imgix's Focal Point Cropping (read about it here: https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url/size/crop).  Right now it only supports focal cropping to a point, however it can use faces that have been detected with the Amazon Rekognition feature of the plugin.  Yes, I know, Imgix has this feature using their face detection and I will add it in the future!
* To use the new Focal Point Cropping, click on `Edit Image` in attachment details to open up the Imgix Image Editor.  Click on the "Focus Crop" tab and go to town.

= 2.0.7 =
* Added WP-CLI support
* Added WP-CLI command `wp mediacloud import` to import the media library to cloud storage from the command line.
* Added WP-CLI command `wp mediacloud regenerate` to rebuild thumbnails for cloud storage from the command line.
* Added WP-CLI command `wp rekognition process` to run the media library through Amazon Rekognition from the command line.

= 2.0.6 =
* Fix for PHP 5.6.  Was using a couple of PHP 7.x features.
* Slimmed down the size of the plugin.

= 2.0.5 =
* Fix for uploading non-image files.  This bug was introduced in 2.0.3.  If you've uploaded non-image files since then, you'll need to re-upload them.  Sorry!
* Hovering over the cloud icon when in the media library grid will display storage info about that file

= 2.0.4 =
* Greatly enhanced the Storage Info panel on the attachment details edit page.  This now shows you all of the different sizes that have been generated, as well as any that might be missing.
* Added the ability to rebuild thumbnails.  If you are using Imgix, this is unnecessary.  If you aren't using Imgix, you should be using Imgix.  You're never going to do better than Imgix.  Relying on WordPress to resize your images and then serve those images from a CDN tied to your cloud storage is a better choice than just serving everything from WordPress, but you are still inserting management tasks into your workflow that Imgix alleviates entirely.  Seriously, check it out.  If you still want to persist with this madness, then this new thumbnail regeneration feature is built just for you.  Enjoy.
* Added "Regenerate Thumbnails" bulk action to WordPress's media library list view.  Use Imgix and you'll never have to worry about this stuff ever again.
